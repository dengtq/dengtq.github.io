Our research focuses on the semiconductor materials and their transport behaviors, with an emphasis on their applications in power electronics and thermoelectrics.

Leveraging upon the state-of-the-art computational methods and our in-house softwares, we study the electron/phonon dynamics and physical/chemical properties governed by interactions among `electrons`, `phonons`, and `defects`.

We also develop tools and workflows for high-throughput transport calculations, including electron and phonon scattering processes and transport properties calculations.

Some of our codes can be found in my [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/dengtq) and [GitHub](https://github.com/dengtq) repositories.
