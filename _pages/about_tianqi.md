Dr Deng Tianqi obtained his Bachelor's degree in physics from University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) in 2011 and PhD degree in materials science and engineering from Nanyang Technological University (NTU) in 2016. He then continued his postdoctoral research in NTU before joining the Institute of High Performance Computing (IHPC), A*STAR as a Scientist. Since 2021, he joined the Advanced Semiconductor Research Institute of ZJU-HIC to lead the computational team.

His research is focused on the semiconductor materials and their electronic structure, electron/phonon dynamics, and physical/chemical properties governed by interactions among electrons, phonons, and defects. His research is primarily computational, with emphasis on theories and high-throughput calculations. He developed the carrier transport property calculation tool [EPIC STAR](https://gitlab.com/dengtq/epicstar).
